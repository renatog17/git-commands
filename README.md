This repo was created as a way to study git. Here, I'll explain git commands that I have been learning.
```
git commit -m '<message>'
```
This command is used to save a state of a project.

---
```
git push -u origin main
```
This command is used when a new project is created. The -u means a link between a local branch and remote branch. It is only needed at the first time, afterwards only ```git push``` can be used.

---

```
git pull
```
Git pull is used to update a local repository with the latest changes from a remote repository.
Another way to do a git pull is using ```git fetch``` and ```git merge``` commands.
